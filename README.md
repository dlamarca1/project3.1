# Digital Innovation: Expert class - Building a microservice structured project using Spring Cloud

During this session we developed a microservice structured project using Spring Cloud

We learned how to use Spring Cloud and with it how to:
     
     Build and configure the microservices modules
     Build a configure-service module
     Build a gateway module
     Build a service discovery module
     
The are two services available:

     Product-catalog (project3 module)
     Shopping-cart
     
  Obs: Still need some microservices connection fixes because the config uri that the configure-service accesses is based on an old git project developed by the teacher
